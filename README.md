## Training

**If you are new to Volto and or React:**

See the training [Mastering of Plone 6 development](https://training.plone.org/) [Prelease] (https://rohberg.github.io/training-plone/mastering-plone/volto_custom_block.html) where I use this use case and code to explain how to create a custom block type and how to create a Volto add-on.

**If you want to create a Volto add-on:**

One way to start is the template `volto-addon-template`
